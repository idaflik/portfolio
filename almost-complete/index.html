			<h3>Visual identity for a temporary exhibition / furniture fair booth</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Simone Affabris, WenFu Chuang</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>In 2017, a group of students was chosen to exhibit work at the international furniture fairs in Stockholm and Milano. Part of the project was self-organizing the exhibition, including the appareance of the exhibition space and print materials. With two other students, I created a visual concept that worked with dashed lines and negative space, which we applied both to the interior architecture of our exhibition space, the logo, and various print materials.
