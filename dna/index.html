			<h3>Development, design and layout for playful exercises around digital security for activists</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Amber Macintyre, Leil Zahra</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As part of my work at <a href="tacticaltech.org">tactical tech</a>, I co-developed a first prototype for the „data and activism“ activity book. The project aims to create playful exercises that make people reflect on their data practices and involve with security aspects of the same. Apart from a first protoype in a book format, we created teaser-cards with some of our exercises, and I created a visual aesthetic for the project borrowing from scrapbooking and activity book elements as well as the „data and activism“ identity colors and existing collage-style artwork.</p>
