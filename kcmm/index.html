			<h3>Design and layout for a book with exercises and thoughts on empowering, anti-discriminatory children‘s pedagogy</h3>
			<hr>
			<p><a href="https://www.kidscourage.de/">KidsCourage</a> is a project working on democratic and anti-discriminatory informal education, children‘s rights and empowerment. In 2019, they published a book about their approach to pedagogy and a collection of their favourite exercises, which I created a layout design as well as illustrations for – based on a corporate identity created by Ipek Erdöl.</p>
