			<h3>An installation-turned-animation to show the different profit shares made from one cup of coffee along the supply chain
			</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Heinrich Ehnert, Marcus Schwalm, Veronika Schneider</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As part of a workshop on data visualization with <a href="http://laloma.info">la loma</a>, we translated data about profit shares into a temporary installation. For the performance, we prepared one cup of coffee and a chain of coffee filters - one for each actor along the supply chain. The filters were treated with invisible impregnation spray so each one would only soak up as much of the coffee liquid as the accoring industry gets in shares of profits, while the rest of the coffee continued dripping down, travelling further along the supply chain. The digital animation is made of photos we took during the performance.
