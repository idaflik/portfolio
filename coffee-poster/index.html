			<h3>An informative miniature landscape, representing the disparity of profits made of coffee in the Global South versus the Global North</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Heinrich Ehnert, Marcus Schwalm, Veronika Schneider</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As part of a workshop on data visualization with <a href="http://laloma.info">la loma</a>, we turned a data-table about profits in the coffee industry into a three-dimensional miniature landscape. The main aim is to communicate the disparity in profits between the production of raw coffee and the roasting and trade industries. Countries that produce raw coffee were prevented from roasting and trading themselves by immoderate customs duties during colonial times – reserving the much more profitable business of roasting and trading coffee for European businesspeople. </p>
			<p>
The first poster shows a ranking of the ten highest-earning countries for both exporting raw coffee (blue flags) and roasted coffee (yellow flags), while the height of their flag indicates the amount of coffee traded per year.
The second poster gives more detailed information about the profits, illustrates the geographical allocation of the countries and includes a short text on the historical background.
