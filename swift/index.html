			<h3>Design and layout of a small publication of the typeface „Swift“</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Robert Hahn</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>A short assignment in the first year of university: to make a booklet showcasing a given font, it‘s history and characteristics. Swift, the typeface we were given, features very characteristic and bold serifs, which became a defining visual in our booklet. The serifs were designed like this to maximize readability despite imperfections in the industrial printing process; the context of industrialization and printing was another key theme in the book. We deconstructed the typeface and played with analogue effects like transparent paper, but mainly we played with layouts, page composition and typographic details.</p>
