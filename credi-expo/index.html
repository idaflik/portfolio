			<h3>A self-build exhibition for showcasing and explaining an NGOs work to its visitors</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Rinos Affafa, Tereza Suchankova</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As part of an internship with <a href="http://credi-ong.org">CREDI-ONG</a>, our team conceptualized and created an exhibition about their work and missions. The outdoor exhibition was put up at the NGOs main site where visitors are frequently welcomed, while most of their projects are spread across different sites in the area and often times difficult to visit. We created a series of vinyl posters and some three-dimensional signs and objects that illustrate and contextualize CREDI-ONGs work. There are some playful interactive elements and games to engage younger visitors (and adults), too!
