			<h3>A permanent DIY exhibition for showcasing and explaining a rural NGOs work to its visitors</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Rinos Affafa, Tereza Suchankova</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As part of an internship with <a href="http://credi-ong.org">CREDI-ONG</a>, our team conceptualized and created an exhibition about their work and missions. The outdoor exhibition was put up at the NGOs main site where visitors are frequently welcomed, while most of their projects are spread across different sites in the area and often times difficult to visit. We created a series of posters and some three-dimensional objects that illustrate the issues CREDI-ONG fights, as well as some games to engage younger visitors (and adults, too!).
