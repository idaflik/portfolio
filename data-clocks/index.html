			<h3>A machine that translates data into drawings</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Data clocks are an installation that document air pollution in real time. Online openly accessible data is translated into an image us humans can read and compare much more intuitively than abstract, numeric data sheets – the format data is usually published in. During the course of one day, the pen moves from the middle to the edge and draws a pattern, that gives us information about the air pollution values during that day: the darker the pattern, the higher the air pollution at that time. This leaves behind a pattern not unsimilar with trees‘ annual rings, that we can also interpret to learn about past living conditions.</p> <p>
For this project, I build and programmed the machines to translate the data into movements. The machines were exhibited in a row of three, comparing the emissions from three places across the world simultaneously.</p>
