			<h3>Design and layout for an annual report including data visualizations</h3>

			<h5>Team: tactical tech in-house team</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>For <a href="tacticaltech.org">tactical tech</a>'s 2019 annual report I created key visuals, the publications layout as well as data visualizations. The key visual / cover was generated by stacking all imagery published throughout the year from the NGOs various projects – a concept that can be applied in the following years to generate new graphics based on the output of that specific year. On the inside, we included creative visualizations of different quantitative data from each project to communicate achievements and the project‘s measurable impacts. The layout was made to work both in print (in an A5 booklet format) as well as in digital form on a wide screen.</p>
